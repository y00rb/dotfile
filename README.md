My dotfile for mac osx
======================
These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.
currently, I prefer used [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus), it
is good to start your vim trip from beginning.
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) in my default
shell.

## Installation(to be continue)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:y00rb/dotfile.git ~/.my_dotfiles
cd ~/.my_dotfiles
```
